# A Simple Notes Single Page App 

Hacked together over the weekend with the VueJS stack and Element-UI.
This is just a toy app that I used to learn the Vue stack.


### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
